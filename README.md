## Description
In this project, we bulit **song recommender systems** using data from [The Million Playlist Datasets](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2018/05/30/introducing-the-million-playlist-dataset-and-recsys-challenge-2018/) released by Spotify.
We registered the songs and playlists from the datasets into a SQLite database, and implemented song recommender systems using both **content-based approach** and **collaborative filtering**.
