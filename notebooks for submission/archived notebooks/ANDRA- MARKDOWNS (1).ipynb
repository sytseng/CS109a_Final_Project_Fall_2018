    "In creating our playlist recommender we had access to three main datasets, the Spotify Million Playlist dataset, the last.fm Million Song Dataset, and the Spotify API which provides quantitative metrics about a given track such as tempo. In this website we describe the creation of our model starting with our Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and the going over a review of the literature on recommender systems. We then demonstrate the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), k-means clustering, and Neural Network Collaborative Filtering (NNCF) models that we used, and discuss their results. Finally, we present an example of playlist generation in action, to provide an intuitive sense for what our model does."

Although our model provided a content-based filtering approach, it was not very robust because the clustering of tracks was not stable. Because of the way the algorithm is built, if clustering is applied repeatedly to different samples from this distribution, it might sometimes construct the horizontal and sometimes the vertical\n",

Therefore, the challenge with applying the k-nn clustering algorithm to recommend songs, we would have to ensure the correct number of clusters is chosen -- otherwise, the model becomes unstable."
